Reading cdf files - pycdf
=========================

pycdf is a module for reading CDF files into python. It is forked directly
without change from the `spacepy`_ project.
However, this is a minimal-dependency version which should be much
easier to install compared to the full spacepy distribution.

To use pycdf after installing HelioPy do

.. code-block:: python

   from pycdf import pycdf
